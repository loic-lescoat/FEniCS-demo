# FEniCS-demo
In this project, the [FEniCS library](https://fenicsproject.org/) is used to solve the Laplace equation in order to simulate a soap film stretched on a rigid frame.

In order to read the project (which is in French), clone the project, install `matplotlib`, `numpy` and `jupyter` using `pip`, then install `FEniCS` according to the [instructions that match your system](https://fenicsproject.org/download/).
Then run `jupyter-notebook "Solving Laplace equation - soap film.ipynb"`.
